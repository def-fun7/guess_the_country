# About ``Country Quiz``

The task or idea was to develop and host a web game that uses components of GIS, i.e. real-world maps, or at least maps in simple.

In the [long series of ideas](#previous-ideas), this indeed was the simplest one as well as one might say easiest, meaning from layout to the function definations (most of them anyways), was written completly by us.

The game in the essence is very simple. You are given a name of the country and ask to locate it on the map. If you found it, you got a win score else you lose. You can keep on trying till you find the country or you can always shuffle again and the country will be skipped and another random country name will be appear.

To add some effects, if what you chose was wrong, a rather funny gif will play in the map frame. This element was added both as a fun and to look into how the overlays works in leaflet.

## Previous Ideas

Other ideas include,

- "Cat's Cradle", a very long complex story based game idea inspired by [Groundhog City Simulation by chri7928](https://chri7928.github.io/candrews/groundhog_city.html)
- A ton of ideas based on map projection using [d3 js Library](https://d3js.org/)
- Game at the end of the world, a blend of sketches made used [p5js](https://d3js.org/) on top of Leaflet, exploring interactivity and dynamic.
- A timeline map of borders of countries, which was later found was already made, check [Historic Maps by ngrapple](https://historicborders.app/) and [Points in History by Hans Hack](https://hanshack.com/point-in-history/)
- A map showing a selected country in selected projection, as fun tool to look how countries shapes changed based on projection, comparing to the [whole world](https://observablehq.com/@d3/projection-transitions)
